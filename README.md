# Juego-de-Memoria


This is a modified version of the classic Memory game. The game is written in Python using the Turtle graphics library.

## Functionalities Added:
1. **Count and Display the Number of Taps**: Tracks and displays the number of taps made by the player during the game.
2. **Detect When All Tiles Are Revealed**: The game now detects when all tiles have been uncovered, indicating the game is won.
3. **Center the Digit in the Tile**: The digit inside each tile is now centered for better visual appeal.
4. **Innovative Gameplay**: Instead of using digits, we have replaced them with letters to make the game more engaging and to enhance memory training.

## Installation:
1. Clone the repository.
2. Ensure you have Python 3.x installed.
3. Run the script using the command:
   ```bash
   python memory.py
